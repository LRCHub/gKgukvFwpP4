Well, one fine day in the month of June
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
I figured that I'd write me a silly little tune
She's a downtown girl for sure
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl for sure
Well, I took her to the tavern for-to have a pint of beer
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
She was dancin' and-a flirtin' wit' ev'rybody there
She's a downtown girl for sure
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl for sure
Well, we went to the regatta for-to see the going's on
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
I took a look away, when I looked but she was gone
She's a downtown girl for sure
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl for sure
Well, I went to her house to meet her mot'er 'n' her fat'er
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
When I got to the door, they confused me wit' anot'er
She's a downtown girl for sure
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl for sure

So if you ever go on for-to have a pint of beer
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
And you see her comin' for you, then you better steer clear
She's a downtown girl for sure
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
She likes waking up with her hair messed up

She's a downtown girl for sure

She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl, she's a get-around girl
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
She's a downtown girl for sure
She likes waking up with her hair messed up
